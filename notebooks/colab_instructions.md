Colab instructions

1. Upload this repository into Colab or mount from Google Drive.
2. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r /content/Promoter-Classification/requirements.txt
```

3. Use `src/train.py` as a starter; in Colab provide paths to FASTA files in `PromoterData/`.
4. Next steps: implement training loop in `src/train.py`, add a notebook `notebooks/colab_train.ipynb` to run experiments interactively.
